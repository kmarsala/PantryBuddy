# PantryBuddy

This project was an andriod app designed for my Senior Capstone class. Myself and four others worked on this app.
Pantry Buddy was designed to assist users in everyday grocery shopping needs. 

My part of this project was the location services that run in the background. A background service is started to track user location when the app is not open. Google Places API is used to find the location of the user and grocercy stores. If the user is wh=ithin 100 meters of a grocery location. The app will check if any items are running low in the pantry. If there are items running low on quantity, the app will send a notification to the user to remind them to chekc what items they will need while at the store.
